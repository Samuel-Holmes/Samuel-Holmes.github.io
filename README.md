## <ins>About Me</ins> 

For my undergraduate degree I studied economics at Sheffield Hallam University, upon completing my course I made the decision that I wished to work within the technology industry. Upon consulting job requirements I realised many of the skills I had learned during my undergraduate degree would be highly transferable, however, I needed to bolster my technical skillset. To achieve this I have undertaken a postgraduate degree within the field of computer science at the University of Sunderland. 

Having recently graduated, I am now seeking a role in which I can build my career as part of an impactful team, one which will allow me to develop and grow whilst being a contributing member. I am particularly interested in roles pertaining to Cybersecurity and Development.  


## Projects 

### Full Stack Web Application - IT Helpdesk Ticketing System

This project is an IT Helpdesk System, one that employs a blend of modern web technologies to streamline support operations. The system incorporates distinct front-end portals for general staff and helpdesk staff, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive interface.
General staff can log in to their portal to create and submit new help requests effortlessly. Simultaneously, helpdesk staff access their dedicated portal to view, manage, and update the status of these requests, marking them as complete when resolved.
On the backend, PHP facilitates seamless communication with a MySQL database, ensuring all data related to active and completed jobs is stored securely and efficiently. This robust integration ensures data persistence, allowing staff to track and manage tasks without losing critical information.

Skills Demonstrated:

Technical Skills:

* Frontend Development: Expertise in HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
* Backend Development: Proficiency in PHP for server-side scripting and dynamic interactions.
* Database Management: Experience with MySQL for creating, managing, and querying relational databases.
* Full-Stack Integration: Combining frontend and backend technologies to create a cohesive application.

Non-Technical Skills:

* Problem-Solving: Designing a system to address real-world challenges faced by an educational institution.
* User-Centric Design: Creating intuitive interfaces tailored to the needs of different user roles.
* Project Planning: Organizing components to deliver a fully functional and reliable solution.
* Collaboration: Incorporating feedback to ensure the system meets the requirements of both staff and helpdesk teams.

This project showcases the application of full-stack web development to address organizational needs, combining technical acumen with practical problem-solving.

### OOP Library Management System

Developed a fully functional Library Management System using Python, showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to design and implement a modular, maintainable, and scalable application. This project demonstrates proficiency in OOP concepts, error handling, and user interaction through a command-line interface.

Key Features:

Description:
Developed a fully functional Library Management System using Python, showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to design and implement a modular, maintainable, and scalable application. This project demonstrates proficiency in OOP concepts, error handling, and user interaction through a command-line interface.

Key Features:

* Book Management: Designed a Books class to create and manage detailed book records, including attributes such as title, author, year, publisher, and availability. Implemented methods for attribute retrieval, updates, and error handling to ensure data integrity.        
* Book Collection: Developed a BookList class to manage a dynamic collection of books. Included functionality to search for books by various attributes, remove books, and track the total inventory.    
* User Management: Created a Users class to define and manage user profiles with detailed personal information. Implemented methods to edit and retrieve user details while maintaining data consistency through exception handling.    
* User Collection: Built a UserList class to store and manage user data, with support for operations like removing users, retrieving user details by username, and counting total users. Added functionality to handle duplicate user names gracefully.    
* Book Loans: Designed a Loans class to manage the borrowing and returning of books, associating books with users through structured data handling. Implemented features to track overdue books and generate user-specific borrowing reports.    
* Interactive Command-Line Interface: Extended the system to provide a user-friendly interface for modifying book and user information directly from the command line.    
* Error Handling and Documentation: Incorporated robust error handling across all components to enhance reliability. Provided detailed inline documentation for maintainability and clarity.

Skills Demonstrated:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Python programming with error handling and data validation
* Data structure manipulation using dictionaries and lists
* Command-line interface design
* Modular and reusable code architecture

The project reinforced my ability to design and implement complex systems using OOP principles and highlighted my problem-solving skills in building a user-centric, reliable application. This experience is highly relevant to cybersecurity roles, as it demonstrates attention to detail, data management, and secure coding practices

### Phishing Attacks â€“ Examining Their Prevalence and Implications for Organisations

This report provides a detailed exploration of phishing attacks, one of the most pervasive threats in cybersecurity. It evaluates the evolution of phishing tactics, including Business Email Compromise (BEC), spear-phishing, and whaling, while emphasizing their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The report highlights the critical need for layered defence mechanisms, such as zero-trust architectures and anti-spoofing technologies, alongside the role of training and incident response planning. It examines both organizational vulnerabilities and societal implications, advocating for a balanced approach that leverages technology and education to mitigate human error. The report demonstrates strong research, analytical, and communication skills, making complex cybersecurity concepts accessible to a diverse audience.

Skills Demonstrated:

* Research and analysis of cybersecurity trends
* Writing technical and accessible content for varied audiences
* Understanding professional and ethical implications in cybersecurity
* Proposing practical, multi-layered defence strategies against phishing
